 - Does `EmitC` really need to be its own trait? It's nice that way because we can express everything as `write.foo()`, but maybe it's needlessly restrictive on what arguments can be passed to `emit`...
 - Should detect a lack of block terminator before we get to construction. Or maybe construction should be able to return an error?
