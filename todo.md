 - Does `EmitC` really need to be its own trait? It's nice that way because we can express everything as `write.foo()`, but maybe it's needlessly restrictive on what arguments can be passed to `emit`...
   - Eventually this wrapper would take a Span reference to produce a better error message.
 - (**CFG construction**) Depending on how future features go in regards to the IR construction step, we may want to reconsider how it's built. Currently it walks the AST and produces IR directly, but this leads to issues w.r.t when some block N needs to jump to block M, but M hasn't been generated yet, so it's not known what index it's at. If instead we do a two-pass approach, first by generating a control-flow-graph that represents basic blocks and their connections, and then *label* that graph such that it corresponds to where each basic block should be in the IR chain, then traversing the graph and constructing IR is easy, requiring no oddities to handle the previously mentioned dependency issues.
 - Make build work for MSVC/Linux/etc (currently only on mingw64)
 - Placing things after final return makes validator think there's no return statement at all.
 - Make all user-defined identifiers have some prefix in the emitted source (`DataType -> _dDataType`, `funcFoo -> _ffuncFoo`, `parameter` -> `_pparameter`, and so on...)
 - validate that structs don't have multiple fields with the same name
 - make internal errors nicer in construct.rs (add internal error enum or something with Display impl)
 - Mutually recursive / out-of-order defined types
    - Will require more elegant way to check for recursive data types
